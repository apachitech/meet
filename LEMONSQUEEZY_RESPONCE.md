Dear Priya,

Thank you for reviewing our application. I am happy to provide the additional details you requested to assist with your KYB/KYC checks and evaluation.

### 1. Pricing Information & Breakdown
Our platform, **[Site Name, e.g., Apacciflix Meet]**, operates on a virtual token economy. Users purchase token packages as one-time transactions. These tokens are then used within the platform to tip content creators (streamers) and unlock interactions during live broadcasts.

We do not currently offer recurring subscriptions; all payments are for non-recurring token packs.

**Current Pricing Tiers:**
*   **Starter Package:** 100 Tokens - $9.99
*   **Popular Package:** 500 Tokens - $45.00
